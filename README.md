This is a proof-of-concept (POC) project using Python and the Behave framework to test a REST API.

### Project Structure:

```plaintext
|-- api_testing_poc/
    |-- features/
        |-- api.feature
    |-- steps/
        |-- api_steps.py
    |-- environment.py
    |-- requirements.txt
```

- **features:** This directory contains your Gherkin feature files that describe the test scenarios.

- **steps:** This directory contains the step definition files where you implement the steps mentioned in your feature files.

- **environment.py:** This file is used to set up the testing environment or perform any global setup before running the tests.

- **requirements.txt:** This file lists the dependencies required for your project. At a minimum, it would include Behave and any other libraries you might use.

### Writing Feature File (`api.feature`):

Create a file named `api.feature` in the `features` directory:

```gherkin
Feature: API Response Validation

  Scenario: Verify the response from the Device ListAPI
    Given Checking API Request with URL "https://iot.sudhi.in/api/v1/device/list/1/2"
    Then the response status code should be 200
    And the response should have a valid JSON format
    And the "status" field in the response should be "SUCCESS"
```

### Writing Step Definitions (`api_steps.py`):

Create a file named `api_steps.py` in the `steps` directory:

```python
import requests
import json
from behave import given, then

@given('I make a GET request to "{url}"')
def step_make_get_request(context, url):
    context.response = requests.get(url)

@then('the response status code should be {status_code}')
def step_check_status_code(context, status_code):
    assert context.response.status_code == int(status_code)

@then('the response should have a valid JSON format')
def step_check_json_format(context):
    json_response = context.response.json()
    assert json_response is not None

@then('the "{field}" field in the response should be "{value}"')
def step_check_json_field(context, field, value):
    json_response = context.response.json()
    assert json_response.get(field) == value
```

### Installing Dependencies:

Create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies:

```bash
cd api_testing_poc
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use "venv\Scripts\activate"
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Tests:

Run Behave to execute your tests:

```bash
behave
```

Behave will discover and execute your feature files, and the step definitions will be matched and executed accordingly.

This is a basic setup for a Behave project to test a REST API. You can expand and customize it based on the complexity of your API and testing requirements.
